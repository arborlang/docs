ArborLang, or just Arbor, is an object oriented programming language, built for building reliable modern applications.

## Why Arbor?

### Portable

Arbor is designed to target WebAssembly as a first class citizen making it ideal for serverless, website development, and backend development.

### Reliability

Arbor is a unique language with robust error recovery and retry logic. As easy to use as a try/catch, but more robust than returning the error. Arbor uses Algebraic side effects to better control your code.

### Strong Types

Arbor is built with on types that don't get in your way. We believe that types are there for humans to read the code, not for computers. We built a type system with this in mind. Arbors type system is a cross between Go's and TypeScript's.
